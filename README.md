# About dataset
This movie dataset was obtained online via Twitter from a user. I wasn't able to find a data dictionary so I gained an understanding of the columns using ChatGPT. It contains 19 tables including; Actor, actor_award, address, advisor, category, country, city, customer, film, film_actor, film_category, film_text, inventory, investor, language, payment, rental, staff & store.


# Objective
You and your business partner were recently approached by another local business 
owner who is interested in purchasing your Movies Rental Business. He primarily owns 
restaurant and bars, so he has lots of questions for you about your business and the rental 
business in general. His offer seems very generous, so you are going to entertain his 
questions. 

Leverage your SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Movies 
Database to answer you potential Acquirerâ€™s questions. Each question will require you to 
write a multi-table SQL query, joining at least two tables.

Attached to this repository are the business questions requiring answers.

# Data Exploration
I loaded all 19 tables into Microsoft SQL where exploration via querying took place inorder to provide answers to the business questions.
